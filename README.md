# Pd-patches
Few Pd patches I've been creating
Could GITHUB be more difficult to let me simply upload a couple files to its repository? 
I understand the fetish with complication that many programmers have, but I'm not one of them
All I wnated was to make public some Pd patches I have been developing but using GITHUB
for that I proving to be so entangled that I guess I will rather use a Google Drive open lin for that
