# Pd-patches
Few Pd patches I've been creating
Could GITHUB be more difficult to let me simply upload a couple files to its repository? 
I understand the fetish with complication that many programmers have, but I'm not one of them. Complication for me is a disease, not a sex toy.
All I wanated when I opened this area was to make publically availabe some Pd patches I have been developing but using GITHUB
for that simple task seems to be so entangled and unnecessary difficult that I guess I will rather use a Google Drive open link for this. 
Thanks a lot, GITHUB!
